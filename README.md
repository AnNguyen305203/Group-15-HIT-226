Project Brief: Environment-Friendly Website for Recycled Material Products

Overview: The goal of this project is to create an e-commerce website that sells products made from recycled materials. The website will focus on promoting eco-friendly and sustainable practices by showcasing products that have been manufactured using recycled materials. The website will target customers who are interested in purchasing environmentally friendly products.

Objectives: The primary objective of this website is to provide customers with an easy and convenient way to purchase products made from recycled materials. The website will promote environmentally conscious consumption and encourage customers to reduce their environmental footprint by choosing recycled products over those that are not.

Target Audience: The target audience for this website will be individuals who are environmentally conscious and interested in purchasing products made from recycled materials. The website will also target individuals who are looking for unique and niche products that cannot be found in traditional retail stores.

Features:

Product Catalog: The website will feature a catalog of products made from recycled materials (Product no decided yet). Each product will have a detailed description of the materials used in its production and the environmental benefits of using recycled materials.

Shopping Cart and Checkout: Customers will be able to add products to their shopping cart and checkout securely using a payment gateway.

Search Functionality: Customers will be able to search for specific products using keywords or filters such as material type, product category, or price range.

Newsletter Signup: Customers will be able to sign up for a newsletter to receive updates on new products and special promotions.

Product Reviews: Customers will be able to leave reviews of products they have purchased to help future customers make informed decisions.

Design: The website will have a clean and minimalist design that focuses on the products and the environmental message. The color scheme will feature earth tones such as green and brown to evoke a natural and eco-friendly feel. (Similar to Urth but not copying, it will involve more green)

Create a sense of contribution: Promote a feature such as we plant 5 trees every pruchase just like Urth did.

Conclusion: This environment-friendly website for recycled material products will serve as a platform to promote sustainable practices and encourage customers to make eco-friendly choices. The products have not been decided yet; however it will be niche. With its focus on unique and niche products made from recycled materials, it will cater to a specific audience and provide a one-stop-shop for all their eco-friendly shopping needs.
